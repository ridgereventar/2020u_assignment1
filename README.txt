The link to my github repository:

https://github.com/ridgereventar/2020u_assignment1

Steps on downloading and running the project:
1) Open the link given above, which will redirect you to my public github repository.
2) Click on "Clone or download" button, and select download ZIP.
3) Locate the ZIP file in file browser and open it to create a folder.
4) Open IntelliJ IDEA.
5) Open the folder.
6) The 'data' folder containing the test and train folders was not included in the github repo.
   Please take a copy of this folder and paste into the 2020u_assignment1 folder.
7) When copying is complete, open the Main.java file.
8) Click the green play button to run the program.
9) When browser prompt appears select the data folder that was copied and pasted.
10) Program will then commence spam detection.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
While programming the assignment, I was training the data with only the 'ham' and 'spam'
folders inside the 'train' folder. Because of this my spam detector works much better when
only these two folders are in the train folder.
However, my program still runs with the 'ham2' folder added in, except accuracy and
precision decreases.

Therefore, to receive high accuracy with my program, remove the 'ham2' and only include
'ham' and 'spam' folders.

Otherwise, include all three and receive a lower accuracy and precision.
